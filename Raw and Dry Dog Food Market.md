Raw dog food, often referred to as a “biologically appropriate” diet, is tailored to mimic the ancestral diet of canines, which is believed to be more natural and beneficial for their health. In the application segmentation of this market, there is a strong demand for raw dog food across various categories such as health maintenance, weight management, and allergy management. Owners seeking to provide their pets with a diet that supports overall well-being are driving the demand for raw dog food products that promote improved digestion, coat health, and energy levels. Additionally, the rise in the popularity of raw feeding trends and the increasing number of pet owners looking for high-quality, nutrient-dense food options contribute to the expansion of this segment. Market players are continually innovating to offer new formulations that cater to specific health needs and preferences of dogs, thereby enhancing the market's growth potential.</p><p>In contrast, the dry dog food market is witnessing robust growth as well, owing to its convenience and longer shelf life compared to raw food options.
