In clinical environments, such as hospitals and specialized rehabilitation centers, these stairs are crucial for post-surgery and injury recovery. They are designed to assist patients in regaining strength, balance, and coordination, which are essential for their rehabilitation process. Clinical applications typically involve customized staircases that can be adjusted in height and angle to cater to specific patient needs, ensuring a safe and effective recovery process.
